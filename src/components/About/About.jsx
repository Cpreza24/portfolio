      <h1>About</h1>
      <p>Im Cesar, A Full-Stack Software Engineer based in Los Angeles, CA
        I have a passion for building tools that make people’s lives easier. Wether it's helping users stay organized or simplifying a workflow. My journey into tech started with a long-standing love for the field, but a full-time career in healthcare kept it on the back burner. After 10 years working as an X-ray technician and medical assistant, I made the leap into software development through a full-time immersive bootcamp.

        I specialize in JavaScript, React, and SQL-based databases, and enjoy building clean, functional applications that solve real problems. Though I dont shy away from learning new technologies and embrace the challenge. I’m confident working independently, but I also thrive in team environments. A skill honed over years of collaborating with clinical teams in high-pressure settings.

        Now, I’m focused on growing as a developer and contributing to meaningful, user-focused applications in a full-stack role.
